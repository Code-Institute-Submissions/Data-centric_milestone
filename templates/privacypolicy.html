            <h5>How do we collect your data?</h5>
            <p>The majority of data we collect is provided upon registration in
                the form of your

                Any other information is volunteered to the website for the
                creation of walks and
                in the context of comments/issues or compliments sent to our <a

            <h5>How will we use your data?</h5>
            <p>Our company collects your data for two purposes:
            <ul>
                <li>For the creation and distribution of walks to and from
                    users.
                    This allows for us to provide a platform where likeminded
                    walkers and explorers can share their experiences and
                    interests.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To respond to any queries or comments you have provided to
                    us; most often forgotten passwords, incorrect material on
                    created walks or concerns with the websites functionality.
                </li>
            </ul>
            We do not sell or share any of your data with any third parties or
            companies.
